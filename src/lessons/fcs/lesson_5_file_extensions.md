## Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore file extensions and file types. Every file on your computer has a name and a file extension. The extension helps you and the computer understand what kind of file it is and what program is needed to open it. This lesson will cover the most common file types you will encounter and help you understand their importance in organizing and using your digital files.

## Understanding File Extensions

### What is a File Extension?

A file extension is the group of letters after the period `.` in a file name, like `.txt` or `.jpg`. It tells the computer what type of file it is, and which programs can open it. For example, a `.txt` file opens in a text editor, while a `.jpg` file opens in an image viewer.

#### Common File Types and Their Extensions

##### 1. Text Files (`.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`)

- `.txt`: A plain text file that contains unformatted text. It’s useful for storing notes, coding, or simple writing.
- `.docx`: A file format used by Microsoft Word for creating formatted documents with text, images, and tables.
- `.pdf`: A Portable Document Format file that displays documents exactly the same way on different devices, perfect for sharing forms, manuals, and more.

##### 2. Image Files (`.jpg`, `.pn`g)

- `.jpg` (or JPEG): A popular file format for storing images, especially photographs. It compresses the image, reducing its file size.
- `.png`: Another image format that supports transparency (invisible background areas), often used for web graphics or icons.

##### 3. Audio Files (`.mp3`, `.wav`)

- `.mp3`: A widely used format for music and sound files. It compresses audio data to make the file smaller.
- `.wav`: An uncompressed audio file that provides high-quality sound but takes up more space on your computer.

##### 4. Executable Files (`.exe`)

- `.exe`: This file format is used for running programs and software on your computer. It’s not meant to be opened like a document or image file. Instead, when you double-click it, the program runs.

#### Why File Extensions Matter

File extensions help you organize and identify different types of files on your computer. They are also crucial for your operating system to know which programs to use when opening a file. For instance, if you try to open a `.jpg` image file in a text editor, it won’t work properly, but if you open it in an image viewer, the file will display correctly.

#### Managing Files by Type

Organizing files by their extensions or file types can help you keep your computer tidy. For example, keeping all your `.docx` files in one folder for homework, `.jpg` files in another folder for photos, and `.mp3` files in a music folder makes it easier to find what you need.
