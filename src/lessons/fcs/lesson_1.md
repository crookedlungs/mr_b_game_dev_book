## What is Computer Hardware?

Computer Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer system that you can see and touch. These components work together to make your computer function, allowing you to perform tasks like playing games, browsing the internet, or doing schoolwork.

## Why is Hardware Important?

Just like a car needs an engine, wheels, and a steering wheel to run, a computer needs its hardware components to operate. Understanding what each piece of hardware does helps you understand how computers work, which is essential for solving problems and building your own systems in the future.

## Key Components of Computer Hardware

Here are the main parts of a computer's hardware:

| Component                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                      | Image                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Central Processing Unit (CPU)  | The CPU is often called the "brain" of the computer. It processes instructions and performs calculations. Whenever you run a program or play a game, the CPU handles most of the work.                                        | If you're playing a game, the CPU calculates the movements of characters and the effects of your actions.    | ![CPU](https://github.com/crookedlungs/mr_b_game_dev_book/blob/42f5ae4a3a49fc7e0029b96d05a99f1552a6b969/media/images/PartsOfACpu/cpu.png?raw=true)   |
| Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) | The GPU is responsible for rendering images and videos on your screen. It's especially important for gaming and video editing because it handles complex visuals.                                                             | When you're playing a game with detailed graphics, the GPU creates the images you see on your screen.        | ![GPU](https://github.com/crookedlungs/mr_b_game_dev_book/blob/888cee5fbff3efa091b1268d7b3653af18720527/media/images/PartsOfACpu/gpu.png?raw=true)   |
| Input/Output Devices           | Input devices, like keyboards and mice, allow you to interact with the computer. Output devices, like monitors and speakers, let the computer communicate back to you.                                                        | When you type on your keyboard (input), the words appear on your monitor (output).                           |                                                                                                                                                      |
| Memory (RAM)                   | RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It's like the computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that the CPU needs quickly. When you run multiple programs at once, they use RAM to keep things running smoothly. | When you open a game and a web browser at the same time, they both use RAM to function without slowing down. | ![RAM](https://github.com/crookedlungs/mr_b_game_dev_book/blob/42f5ae4a3a49fc7e0029b96d05a99f1552a6b969/media/images/PartsOfACpu/ram.png?raw=true)   |
| Motherboard                    | The motherboard is like the computer's backbone. It connects all the other components and allows them to communicate with each other.                                                                                         | The CPU, RAM, and GPU all plug into the motherboard so they can work together.                               | ![MOBO](https://github.com/crookedlungs/mr_b_game_dev_book/blob/42f5ae4a3a49fc7e0029b96d05a99f1552a6b969/media/images/PartsOfACpu/mobo.png?raw=true) |
| Power Supply Unit (PSU)        | The PSU provides power to all the components of the computer. Without it, nothing would work.                                                                                                                                 | The PSU converts electricity from the wall into a form that the computer components can use.                 |                                                                                                                                                      |
| Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)    | This is where all your files, games, and software are stored permanently. A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) uses spinning disks to store data, while a Solid State Drive (SSD) uses flash memory, which is faster and more reliable.    | The game you downloaded is stored on your hard drive or SSD, ready to be accessed whenever you want to play. |                                                                                                                                                      |

## How Do These Components Work Together?

All these hardware components work together to make a computer function. The CPU processes instructions, RAM holds the data itâ€™s working on, the GPU handles the graphics, and the motherboard makes sure everything is connected. The hard drive stores your data, and the PSU provides power. Input devices let you control the computer, and output devices show you the results.

## Conclusion

Understanding computer hardware is fundamental to learning how computers work. Each component has a specific role that contributes to the overall performance of the system. By knowing what each part does, you can better understand how to use, troubleshoot, and even build your own computer systems in the future.
