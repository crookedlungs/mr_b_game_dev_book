## Quest 1 - File Structure

Today, we will create the file and folder structure for our space shooter game.

#### Instructions

Complete the following steps in order to complete today's work.

- **1:** On your desktop, create a folder named `Projects`
  - You can make a new folder by using `right-click` on your mouse and then selecting `New` and then `Folder`. [Need Help?](../../../../skills/basic_skills/create_folder.md)
- **2:** Open the `Projects` folder and then create a new folder called `SpaceShooterGame`
- **3:** Open the `SpaceShooterGame` folder and then create another new folder called `Sprites`
- **4:** Move each [sprite](../../../../vocabulary.md#sprite) into the new `Sprites` folder.
- **5:** Your [sprites](../../../../vocabulary.md#sprite) should have the following names.
  - We will use the [PascalCase](../../../../vocabulary.md#pascal-case) naming convention for our files.

| Description | File Name      |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Space Ship  | SpaceShip.png  |
| Asteroid #1 | Asteroid01.png |
| Asteroid #2 | Asteroid02.png |
| Asteroid #3 | Asteroid03.png |
| Asteroid #4 | Asteroid04.png |
| Laser Beam  | LaserBeam.png  |
| Star        | Star01.png     |

<div class="warning">
Your folder and file structure should look exactly like this.

```cpp
~/*
- Projects (folder)
-- SpaceShooterGame (folder)
--- Sprites (folder)
---- SpaceShip.png (file)
---- Asteroid01.png (file)
---- Asteroid02.png (file)
---- Asteroid03.png (file)
---- Asteroid04.png (file)
---- LaserBeam.png (file)
---- Star01.png (file)
~*/
```

</div>

- **6:** Go to [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) and create a new folder called `Projects`
- **7:** Right-click inside of your new `Projects` folder and click `Folder Upload`
