## Introduction

In the world of video games, people play for different reasons. Some love to explore new worlds, others enjoy competing against their friends, and some just want to relax and have fun. Understanding what motivates people to play games can help game designers create better experiences. One popular way to categorize players is through [Bartle's Taxonomy](../../vocabulary.md#bartles-taxonomy), developed by Richard Bartle.

## Bartle's Taxonomy

[Bartle's Taxonomy](../../vocabulary.md#bartles-taxonomy) divides players into four main types: **Achievers**, **Explorers**, **Socializers**, and **Killers**. Let's explore what makes each of these player types unique and how understanding them can help in designing games.

### Achievers

Achievers are players who love to accomplish goals and collect rewards. They are motivated by points, levels, badges, and completing challenges. For Achievers, the game is all about reaching the highest score, unlocking all the achievements, and being the best. They feel satisfied when they master a game and show off their accomplishments to others. When designing games for Achievers, it's important to include clear goals, rewards, and challenges that allow them to track their progress.

### Explorers

Explorers are curious and love to discover new things. They enjoy exploring the game world, finding hidden secrets, and learning about the game’s story and mechanics. Explorers are motivated by curiosity and the thrill of discovery. They don't care as much about winning or completing the game quickly; instead, they take their time to uncover every corner of the game. To keep Explorers engaged, designers should include detailed environments, interesting backstories, and plenty of secrets or Easter eggs to find.

### Socializers

Socializers play games to connect with other people. For them, the game is a way to meet new friends, chat with others, and work together as a team. Socializers are motivated by the relationships they build and the interactions they have with other players. They might enjoy multiplayer games where they can collaborate with others or social games where they can chat and share experiences. To appeal to Socializers, game designers should focus on creating opportunities for teamwork, communication, and community-building within the game.

### Killers

Killers are competitive players who love the thrill of victory, especially when it involves defeating others. They are motivated by competition and dominance. Killers enjoy player-versus-player (PvP) games where they can challenge and defeat other players. They thrive on the excitement of battles, and they like to test their skills against real opponents. To keep Killers engaged, designers should create competitive environments, leaderboards, and opportunities for direct player conflict.

## Conclusion

[Bartle's Taxonomy](../../vocabulary.md#bartles-taxonomy) helps us understand that players have different motivations and play styles. By recognizing these four player types—Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, and Killers—game designers can create games that appeal to a wide range of players. Whether you're designing a game for people who love competition, exploration, social interaction, or achievement, understanding what drives your audience can help you create a more engaging and enjoyable gaming experience. As you continue learning about game design, think about which type of player you are and how that might influence the games you want to create.
