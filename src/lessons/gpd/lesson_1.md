# Lesson 1 - What is a Game Design Document (GDD)?

Standards: [GPD.1A](~GPD1A) | [GPD.1B](~GPD1B)

## What is a Game Design Document?

A [**Game Design Document (GDD)**](../terms/gdd.md) is like a blueprint for your game. It’s a detailed guide that explains:

- how your game will work
- what it will look like
- how players will interact with it

Think of it as the plan that helps everyone on the game development team understand the vision for the game.

### Why is a GDD Important?

Creating a game is a big task, and it often involves many people working together, like artists, programmers, writers, and designers. The GDD helps keep everyone on the same page. It makes sure that everyone knows what the game is supposed to be like, so there’s no confusion or misunderstandings during development.

### What Does a GDD Include?

A GDD usually has several key sections:

- **Game Overview:** This is the big picture of your game. It includes the title, genre, and a brief description of what the game is about. This section answers the question: _What is this game?_

- **Story and Setting:** If your game has a story, this section describes it. It also explains the world where the game takes place. Is it a fantasy world with dragons, or a futuristic city with robots? This section brings your game’s world to life.

- **Gameplay Mechanics:** These are the rules of your game. It explains how players will interact with the game, like what buttons they’ll press and what actions their character can do. For example, if your game is a platformer, this section might describe how the character jumps and runs.

- **Characters and Enemies:** This section lists all the characters in the game, including the main character, side characters, and enemies. It describes what they look like, what they can do, and their role in the game.

- **Levels and Environments:** Here, you describe the different levels or stages of your game. What challenges will players face? What does each level look like? This section helps map out the player’s journey through the game.

- **Art and Sound:** This section describes the visual and audio style of your game. What kind of art style will you use—cartoony, realistic, pixel art? What kind of music and sound effects will play during the game?

- **User Interface (UI):** The UI is everything the player interacts with on the screen, like menus, buttons, and health bars. This section explains how the UI will look and work.

### How Do You Use a GDD?

Once your GDD is written, it becomes the roadmap for your game’s development. As you start building the game, you and your team will refer back to the GDD to make sure you’re following the plan. If you need to make changes to the game, you’ll update the GDD to reflect those changes.

### Conclusion

A Game Design Document is a crucial tool in game development. It helps you organize your ideas and communicate them clearly to others. Whether you’re working on a small game by yourself or a big project with a team, a well-crafted GDD will make the process smoother and more successful.
