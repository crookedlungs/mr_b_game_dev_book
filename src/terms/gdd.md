# Game Design Document

## Definition

A game design document (GDD) is a comprehensive and detailed plan for a video game project. It outlines the game's concept, mechanics, story, art, sound, and other elements. The GDD serves as a roadmap for developers, designers, and other stakeholders, providing clear guidance and ensuring that all aspects of the game are aligned with the project's goals.

## Examples

- Game mechanics and rules
- Storyline and character development
- Art style and asset requirements
- Sound design and music
- User interface design
- Technical specifications and platform requirements
